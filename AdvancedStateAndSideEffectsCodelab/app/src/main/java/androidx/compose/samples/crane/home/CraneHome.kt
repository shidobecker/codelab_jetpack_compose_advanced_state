/**
 * LaunchedEffect vs rememberCoroutineScope
Using LaunchedEffect in this case wasn't possible because we needed to trigger the call to create a coroutine
in a regular callback that was outside of the Composition.

Looking back at the landing screen step that used LaunchedEffect, could you use rememberCoroutineScope and
call scope.launch { delay(); onTimeout(); } instead of using LaunchedEffect?

You could've done that, and it would've seemed to work, but it wouldn't be correct. As explained in the
Thinking in Compose documentation, composables can be called by Compose at any moment.
LaunchedEffect guarantees that the side-effect will be executed when the call to that composable
makes it into the Composition. If you use rememberCoroutineScope and scope.launch in the body of the
LandingScreen, the coroutine will be executed every time LandingScreen is called by Compose regardless of
whether that call makes it into the Composition or not. Therefore, you'll waste resources and you won't be
executing this side-effect in a controlled environment.
